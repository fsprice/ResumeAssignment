        <h1>Francine Price</h1>
        <h2>Front-End Developer</h2>

        <p>I'm an entry-level front-end engineer with a distinctive blend of academic and technical prowess. My educational journey commenced with a B.A. in Spanish accompanied by a minor in linguistics. Delving into the intricacies of language and communication laid the foundation for my subsequent pursuit of a M.A. in Spanish, focusing on Translation and Translation Studies.
</p>
        <p>Transitioning from the world of academia to technology, I cultivated a strong skill set in front-end development. My proficiency spans HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the bedrock of my ability to craft engaging web interfaces. Harnessing the power of frameworks like Bootstrap and React.js, I adeptly construct dynamic and user-centric digital experiences.</p>
        <p>My passion for language extends harmoniously into the realm of coding. I am driven by the quest to create seamless, responsive, and visually captivating websites that transcend cultural boundaries. This unique fusion of linguistic insight and technical expertise allows me to contribute meaningfully to diverse projects.</p>
